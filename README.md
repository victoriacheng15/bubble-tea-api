# Bubble Tea Home

It is a home to bubble tea app where users can mix and match their favorite drinks. The users also can learn short and simple history of bubble tea. There is also a leaderboard that shows which drinks are the most loved by people. :D

> A warning, the drag and drop feature doesn't work on mobile, so for your best experience, please access this app on non-mobile devices. 

## Motivation and Learning

I love bubble tea and curious to see what are other favorites as well.

The purpose of this project:
- Learning about drag and drop API
- Send information to the database
  - Check database to see if information existed or not,
    - If not existed, insert new data
    - If existed, update the count for leaderboard
- Make sure the the choices contains 1 of each type, tea and topping
  - If not, the submit button stays disabled
- The ability of clear choices
